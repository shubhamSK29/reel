Fractured Keys is an experimental approach to secure credential storage that avoids traditional single-point vaults.
Instead of keeping an encrypted blob in one place, the data is divided, transformed, and distributed across multiple independent carriers.

This project explores:

- Offline security models — no reliance on online services.

- Redundancy with thresholds — only partial components are required to recover the whole.

- Steganographic concealment — information is embedded where it is least expected.

- Layered cryptography — multiple primitives combined to resist straightforward analysis.

The result is a system that doesn’t resemble a password manager in its raw form — the stored material does not look like secrets at all.

Fractured Keys is research-driven, cross-platform, and intended for educational and experimental use.


Key Ideas

- Storage without central vaults.

- Recovery through controlled reconstruction.

- Blending security mechanisms from multiple domains (cryptography, coding theory, image processing).
